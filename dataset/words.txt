There is a bit of a haze in our atmosphere thanks to smoke billowing from five major wildfires in Southern California.
Looking at satellite imagery today you can clearly see smoke spiraling from the fires just north of Los Angeles and spilling out into the Pacific Ocean.
High pressure situated over the California / Nevada border is to blame for sending the smoke north.
Winds around high pressure flow in a clockwise fashion and those winds are not only sending smoke into the Bay Area, but are also responsible for the strong winds in Southern California that continue to spread the wildfires.
